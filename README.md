# Navigating India's Trade Dynamics (1997-2023)

📌 Objective

This project explores India’s international trade dynamics (2000–2023), focusing on trade deficits, key commodities, and external economic indicators. 
The goal is to provide actionable insights for policymakers, businesses, and stakeholders by analyzing imports, exports, FDI inflows, and global competitiveness.

📂 Data Sources

Government Trade Portals (e.g., Ministry of Commerce)

Primary source for import–export data by country and commodity

Open-Source Datasets (e.g., Statista, Macrotrends, Wikipedia)

Used for inflation, innovation index, market capitalization, population, FDI, logistics performance

Data pre-processed and validated in Power BI for accurate analysis





💡 Key Insights

Trade deficit widened sharply from $6B in 2000 to $330B in 2023.

Imports surged due to energy dependency (~$120B annually on crude oil).

Exports grew but lagged behind, driven mainly by pharma, engineering, and petroleum products.

India ranked 4th globally in market capitalization ($5.7T, Jan 2024), signaling investor confidence.

FDI inflows reached $84B in 2022, driven by technology and manufacturing.

Inflation volatility influenced currency and competitiveness.

✅ Recommendations

Diversify energy sources to reduce crude oil dependency.

Boost high-value exports like pharmaceuticals, engineering, and IT services.

Strengthen trade relations beyond China to reduce reliance on imports.

Enhance logistics and infrastructure to sustain export competitiveness.

Leverage digital economy & e-commerce as growth drivers.
